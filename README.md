### :dart: Features
- Monthly Sales Distribution: The project aims to visualize and analyze the sales distribution trends on a monthly basis. This involves creating visual representations such as line charts or bar graphs to showcase the fluctuations in sales throughout the year. Insights derived from this analysis can provide valuable information on seasonal variations and help in strategic planning.
- City-wise Sales Metrics: The project seeks to explore and present sales data on a city-wise basis. This involves the mapping of sales trends in different geographical locations. By visualizing city-wise sales patterns, the analysis aims to identify high-performing regions and potential areas for market expansion or improvement.
- Stock Availability Metrics: An essential aspect of the project involves determining stock availability metrics based on products that have been sold out. This includes calculating the remaining stock for each product and identifying products that are close to being sold out. Insights derived from this analysis can aid in inventory management, ensuring that popular products are adequately stocked to meet customer demand.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare the Kaggle dataset by addressing any missing or inconsistent data, ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain initial insights into the dataset. This includes summary statistics, data distribution, and identifying outliers.
- Monthly Sales Distribution Analysis: Create visualizations such as line charts or bar graphs to represent the monthly sales distribution. Analyze the trends and patterns to understand the seasonality of sales.
- City-wise Sales Analysis: Utilize geographical information in the dataset to create maps or charts showcasing city-wise sales metrics. Identify regions with high sales and potential areas for improvement.
- Stock Availability Metrics Calculation: Determine the remaining stock for each product by analyzing sold-out items. Calculate metrics such as stock turnover rate and identify products with low stock levels.
- Visualization and Reporting: Present the findings through interactive visualizations and a comprehensive report. Highlight key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
